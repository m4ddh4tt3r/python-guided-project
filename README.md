# Python Guided Project - Widget Wonders

Hello and welcome to Widget Wonders. We brought your team together to help assist us with a project
we are working on for a client. Your team will be responsible for writing a series of business logic for an
upcoming project centered around polygons. We are developing a project for calculating aspects of
polygons for education. Below is a list of the polygons we would like the business logic built for.

The specific calculations we are interested in having your work-out are the area, perimeter and height.
The calculations will be based on supplying the length values for each side. Once you have completed
the business logic, we would like you to write a simulated user experience to verify that your calculations
are working properly. Assume all values entered are treated as whole numbers or numbers with decimal
points. We would also like the decimal point values to be no more than 3 decimal places and if possible,
round up.

#### Polygon Types:
- Quadrilateral
  - Square
  - Rectangle
  - Parallelogram
- Pentagon (Assume all sides are equal)
- Hexagon (Assume all sides are equal)
- Triangle
  - Equilateral
  - Isosceles
  - Scalene

To aid you on this project, we have found some websites with most of the information you need. They
are posted below. Any additional information you will need will have to be searched for. There may be
additional polygon types or calculations that we will need. We will update you as we see your progress.

We will be working through this guided project in phases. We will not be writing any code until we have
broken down the requirements, completed research for those requirements and created some kind of
design. The instructor will be the one creating the design using a UML class diagram. There is a free
web application that can be used for this at: apps.diagrams.net.
